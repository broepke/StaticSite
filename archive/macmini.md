When apple announced the new M1 chip I ordered a Mac Mini.  It simply blows away any other computer I've had the pleasure to use.  It is super responsive and quiet.  I've only run into a single issue with running Tableau.  It says the processor isn't compatible.  I'm sure that will be resolved sooner or later.

I purchased it with the following configuration:

 * Apple M1 chip with 8‑core CPU, 8‑core GPU, and 16‑core Neural Engine
 * 16GB unified memory
 * 1TB SSD storage

And paired it with the [LG 27MD5KL-B 27 Inch UltraFine 5K display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XV9NQSJ).  The image on the display is amazing but I find the base poorly constructed causing it to wobble when I type.

(More to come)
