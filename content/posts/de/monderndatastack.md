# What is the Modern Data Stack?

There is a term floating around called the **Modern Data Stack**.  It's a bit overused, but what it means is that you're taking advantage of the **best technology** out there.  The challenge with the modern data stack is that as an individual, you might struggle to get everyhing up and running for a very **low cost**.  For me, I want to learn, but i'm not going to drop *$10,000* in getting started fees for a workflow orchestration tool. I want to build a stack that helps me learn, stay relevant, and get the job done. Here is my current set of tools of choice! 

A note to vendors out there.  If your entry point is $10,000, or $30,000 or more, **You're doing SaaS wrong**.  Fix it.  I've sold enterprise software for decades and this price point means two things.  You don't have your operational expenses under control or you've purposesly decided to go after *only* enterprises to compensate for a poor GTM strategy.  

My criteria for selecting them is as follows.

* **Best In Class**: They should be the leader in their space, if possible, or offer a very similar experience to the leader.
* **Low Cost or Free**: Specifically for Small Teams and Individuals.  This includes ensuring that the free tier is usable in a basic workflow.
* **Great Documentation**: Great products have great documentation.  Each one of my selections are fantastic.
* **Ecosystem**: You want to ensure that you're not the only user. Are people asking questions in public forums? Are there accessible support channel if needed?

## Other Notable Mentions

* **VSCode**: Python, Git, Extensions, Debugging.  It's fantastic.  The best IDE out there.
* **GitHub**: Even if you're a single person, you should be using GitHub. Showcase your work and get used to the workflow.
* **PIP**: I used to use Conda exclusively, but I've switched to PIP.  Feels like a more natural workflow for me.
* **Docker**: Grab Docker Desktop and the Docker Hub when you want to install various tools locally.  It saves a ton of time.
