## What is Classification in Machine Learning?

At it's simpliest form there are two genearly types of supervised machine learning outcomes.  First you can have a regression problem, where you're trying to predict a continuous variable, such as the temperature or a stock price.  Second is a classification problem where you want to predict a categorical variable such as pass/fail, or spam/ham.  Additionally we can have binary classificaiton problems which we'll cover here where there are only two outcomes, and multi-class classification where there are more than two outcomes.
