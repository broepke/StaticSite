Amazingly enough you can turn your iPad into a near fully fledge development
environment for Python, HTML, CSS, and Markdown.  Here are the needed
apps:

* [Pythonista 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) -
Python IDE
* [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) -
A powerful Git client
* [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-8/id1049254261) -
A multi-purpose text editor with language support
* [Juno](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-jupyter-notebook/id1462586500) -
Jupyter Notebook Editor for your iPad

A couple of great videos I used to get this all set up and learn a little more
on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) by Tech Craft.

_Note: These are all paid, apps.  But they are worth it if you want to
develop on the go_
