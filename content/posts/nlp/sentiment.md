## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis helps understand the tone of text data, positive, negative, or neutral. Capturing sentiment can help organizations better understand the **Voice of Customer (VOC)** and even direct product development to improve functionality [^IJCA].  Often times sentimen analysis is lexicon based, meaning it simply does a lookup on words that are tagged by humans as positive, negative, or neutral.  There are more advanced models avaialble such as BERT, which was opensourced by Google in 2018 [^BERT].  This post will cover the more traditional lexicon based approach, we'll take a look at the deep learning models at a later time.

There are a new terms that you need to be familiar with in order to interpret the results.  They are simple concepts but understanding them up front will help you follow along better.

* **Polarity**: A value expressing the degree of emotion of a sentence from negative to positive. A value within the range [-1.0, 1.0] (negative sentiment => -1.0, neutral => 0.0, positive sentiment => 1.0)
* **Subjectivity**: A subjective sentence expresses some personal feelings, views, or beliefs.  The subjectivity is a value within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.

## Twitter Data

For this example we're going to use data extracted from Twitter.  Twitter is an excellent source for **VOC** analysis.  You can search a product name, a hastag, mentions, or a company name.  For Python we can use the [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/#) wrapper of the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en).  

In serching for great examples of data that would be **highly positive** or **highly negative**, I just happened to be writing this and downloading data the moment the [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/29/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-guilty-verdict.html) trial verdict was being read and figured that would be a great place to start for negative.  Who would be the opposite, where nearly all tweets would be positive? I chose [Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM).

I won't cover the actual code I used to exctact the Tweets, but all of it available here if you would like to try this on your own: [Tweet Extraction Notebook](https://github.com/broepke/SentimentAnalysis/blob/main/twitter.ipynb)

As usual, let's import the libraries we'll be using and import our data to get started.

```python
import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob

from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
```python
swift = pd.read_pickle('swift.pkl')
maxwell = pd.read_pickle('maxwell.pkl')
```

**Note**: *We are using the original VADER library not NLTK's implementation.  The NLTK library is behind on the version of VADER is has incorporated and doesn't support some of the newer features such as translating utf-8 encoded emojis.*

## Sentiment Analysis with TexBlob

**TexBlob** is a package that I like to use for quick NLP projects.  It's a simple Python API that supports common tasks like sentiment analysis.  It contains two different sentiment analyzers. The first is one called [`PatternAnalyzer`](https://github.com/clips/pattern) and the other is NLTKs `NaiveBayesAnalyzer` which is trained on a movie reviews corpus.

Getting the **polarity** (or **subjectivity**) score from TextBlob is simple.  We can use the Panda's `apply` method to get the `sentiment.plarity` for each tweet.

```python
# Apply the Polarity Scoring from TextBlob
swift['blob'] = swift['text'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity)
swift.head()
```
```text
   TWEET                                                POLARITY
0  RT @TSwiftFTC: ü•á According to @HITSDD, Taylor ...   1.000000
1  RT @taylorr_media: Taylor Swift - All Too Well...    0.000000
2  Taylor swift and ed sheeran music mainly. And ...    0.166667
3  RT @soitgoes: taylor swift didn't write:...          0.200000
4  Suporte list: Nial Horan, Demi Lovato, Taylor ...    0.000000
```

As simple as that, we have our polarity scores.  We can see in the above examples we have some ranging from neutral to the max positive value of `1.0`.  Quite often your text will have a neutral sentiment.  Since neutral tweets do not add any information for the analysis, we can remove them and leave only those postive and negative.

```python
# Get rid of neutral sentiment
filter = swift['blob'] != 0
swift = swift[filter]
```

And next plot our results.  I'm using the `histplot` from [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html).  Histograms are an ideal way to visualize polarity scores given then can nicely be binned into the range of -1.0 to 1.0.

```python
sns.histplot(swift, x='blob', color="#7C8C58", bins=10)
plt.title("Taylor Swift Sentiment Distribution with TextBlob")
plt.xlabel("Sentiment")
plt.ylabel("")
```
You can see below how the Taylor Swift tweets are mostly positive, while the Maxwell tweets are mostly negative.

## Social Media Sentiment Analysis with Vader

TextBlob is not optimized for shorter text or social media posts.  It's better suited for longer strings or those that are clean and written in common language patterns.  However, tools tuned explicitly to social media have emerged that understand how to deal with the language patterns used in social media and even handling items such as emoji characters in text. One such is **VADER** (*Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner*) library [^VADER].  Some of the things VADER handles specifically for social media are:

* **Booster Words**:  Words that increase the sentiment like **great** or **love**
* **ALL CAPS**: Words that are all caps are often used to amplify emotion (**GREAT**)
* **Punctuation**: Marks such as **!** or **!!!** will increase the sentiment
* **Slang**: Words such as **SUX** or **BFF** are interpreted correctly
* **Emoji**: **UTF-8** encoded emojis are handled correctly

**Note:** *It's important that strings are not [cleaned]({filename}textcleaning.md) like you normally might with other NLP methods.  There is a lot of context that VADER will take away from the unproccessed text.*

Before we jump into our twitter data, let's take a look at a how couple of strings containing only emjoi are processed.

```python
positive = "üíï üòÅ üéâ"
negative = "üíî üò¨ üôÅ"
```
```text
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.375, 'pos': 0.625, 'compound': 0.875}
{'neg': 0.514, 'neu': 0.203, 'pos': 0.284, 'compound': -0.3415}
```

Where the two strings would have returned `0.0` with TextBlob, with **VADER** they show `compound` scores that appear to be inline with the emotion that the emojis represent.

Let's try to do the same process as above but utilizing the VADER library.  We'll use the same `apply` method on the Data Frame.

```python
# Add the polarity scores
swift['vader'] = swift['text'].apply(lambda x: sid.polarity_scores(x))
```
```text
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.7184}
```

The resulting column is actually a **dictionary** of different **key-value pairs**.  The key-value that represents the TextBlob `sentiment` is the one called `compound`.  We can extract it with the following function applied to our dataframe:

```python
# Extract only the compound score value
swift['compound'] = swift['vader'].apply(lambda score_dict: score_dict['compound'])
```

After plotting our results again we can see that VADER gives a better representation of the sentiment. Scores for Swift are more positive biased and Maxwell are more negative biased.  The reason for this is that more emojtion in the smaller strings is captured whether that's emoji or other common ways people emphasize emotion in Tweets.

## Conclusion

There you have it! Voice of Customer analysis of sentiment on Social Media data.  This is just a start to what you can do and how you might leverage this information however, it's a powerful tool in your toolbox to better understand your customers and their emotions.
