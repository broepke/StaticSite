## What is a Topic Model?

The method used is referred to as Topic Modeling. The specific methodology used in this analysis is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a probabilistic model for generating groups of words associated with n topics. In LDA, the algorithm looks at documents as a mixture of topics. The topics are a mixture of words, and the algorithm calculates the probability of each word associated with a topic [^BLEI].
