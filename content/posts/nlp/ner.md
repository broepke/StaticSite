## What is Named Entity Recognition?


```python
import spacy
from spacy import displacy

text = "Mr. Bidenâ€™s announcement came as several new cases of the Omicron variant were reported in the United States, including five people in New York State, a Minnesota resident who had recently traveled to New York City and a Colorado resident who had recently returned from southern Africa. Hawaii also reported its first known case, and California its second."

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(text)
displacy.render(doc, style="ent")
```

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
# Merge noun phrases and entities for easier analysis
nlp.add_pipe("merge_entities")
nlp.add_pipe("merge_noun_chunks")

TEXTS = [
    "Net income was $9.4 million compared to the prior year of $2.7 million.",
    "Revenue exceeded twelve billion dollars, with a loss of $1b.",
]
for doc in nlp.pipe(TEXTS):
    for token in doc:
        if token.ent_type_ == "MONEY":
            # We have an attribute and direct object, so check for subject
            if token.dep_ in ("attr", "dobj"):
                subj = [w for w in token.head.lefts if w.dep_ == "nsubj"]
                if subj:
                    print(subj[0], "-->", token)
            # We have a prepositional object with a preposition
            elif token.dep_ == "pobj" and token.head.dep_ == "prep":
                print(token.head.head, "-->", token)
```
