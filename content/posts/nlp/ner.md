```python
import spacy
from spacy import displacy

text = "Mr. Bidenâ€™s announcement came as several new cases of the Omicron variant were reported in the United States, including five people in New York State, a Minnesota resident who had recently traveled to New York City and a Colorado resident who had recently returned from southern Africa. Hawaii also reported its first known case, and California its second."
