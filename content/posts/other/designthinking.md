# What is Design Thinking?

The first thing you might be thinking is "What does design thinking have to do with Data Science?!"  Let's start with a definition of [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) and then let's see how everyone can apply Design Thinking Methods to Data Science.

According to one the early pioneers of Design thinking, [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com), they define Design Thinking as:

>Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designerâ€™s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

A few things jump out.  First is that it's a human-centered approach, which means that you're designing solutions in service of people, not of technology.  Every Data Scientist and Analyst should be thinking about the user first! Second is that it's taking tools from designers and applying them to generalized business success. Design Thinking isn't just for designers and it certainly isn't just for software User Interfaces (UI)!

As a Data Scientist, there are numerous ways that you can incorporate Design Thinking into your work to help solve problems such as:

1. Stakeholder Management
2. Identifying the Most Important Problem to Solve
3. Prioritizing Work
4. Getting Thoughful Critique
5. Determing the Usability of Your Solution
6. Build a Launch Plan

Before jumping in, let's take a look a a few fundamentals of Design Thinking.

## The Double Diamond

The first I want to talk about is the concept of the Double Diamond

## How Might We

You may have heard this phrase before, **How Might We** which is often abbreviated to **HMW**. These three powerful little words help us frame a problem statement in a powerful, inclusive way.

- **How** suggesting that we don't yet know what the solution is.
- **Might** suggesting that a solution is possible and there could be several ways to implement it.
- **We** brings everyone together to help solve the problem.

You'll see this quite a bit when practicing Design Thinking.  I suggest you try it yourself and see how it invites collaboration help open up your problem statement to new perspectives.  Let's take a look at a quick example:

**from**

*Build a reccomender system for music*

**to**

*How might we queue up music that will delight users and keep them listening for hours?*

Notice the difference? Much more inspiring and also brings the user into the problem.


## Design Thinking Methods

There are many different design thinking methods that you can utilize.  There probably are hundreds or even thousands of them. Different organizations have curated "systems" of design thinking methods and selected ones for you such as [IDEO's Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/methods), [Google Design Sprints](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) or the set that I'm certified in, the [LUMA Institudes Methods](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).


Here are a full list of the LUMA methods from their [website](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).  We'll cover several of these in this post, but in reality, every one of these can apply at some point in time to Data Science.  Each method is documented on their website if you'd like to learn more.
