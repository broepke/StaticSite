# What is Design Thinking?

The first thing you might be thinking is "What does design thinking have to do with Data Science?!"  Let's start with a definition of [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) and then let's see how everyone can apply Design Thinking Methods to Data Science.

According to one the early pioneers of Design thinking, [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com), they define Design Thinking as:

>Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designerâ€™s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

A few things jump out.  First is that it's a human-centered approach, which means that you're designing solutions in service of people, not of technology.  Every Data Scientist and Analyst should be thinking about the user first! Second is that it's taking tools from designers and applying them to generalized business success. Design Thinking isn't just for designers and it certainly isn't just for software User Interfaces (UI)!

As a Data Scientist, there are numerous ways that you can incorporate Design Thinking into your work to help solve problems such as:

1. Stakeholder Management
2. Identifying the Most Important Problem to Solve
3. Prioritizing Work
4. Getting Thoughful Critique
5. Determing the Usability of Your Solution
6. Build a Launch Plan, Before You Build

Before jumping in, let's take a look a a few fundamentals of Design Thinking.

## The Double Diamond

The first I want to talk about is the concept of the **Double Diamond**.  The [Double Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)) is a core concept in design thinking and helps you frame how to think about approaching a problem, and developing a solution.  The concept is that you start from left and do two sets of **divergent** and **convergent** exercises that help you first identify **the problem** to solve, and then explore a broad space again around the solution, finally coming up with **the solution**.  Two words you will hear a lot in design thinking are divergent and convergent.

- **Divergent**: Opening your mind to a broad range of possibiliites. As my friend and mentor says
>"it's easier to tame a wild idea than to amplify a weak one.
- **Convergent**: Narrowing down the range of possibilities to a singular one.

The Double Diamond and divergent and convergent thinking are applied to different methods in design thinking to help facilitate comming up with the soltuion.

## How Might We

You may have heard this phrase before, **How Might We** which is often abbreviated to **HMW**. These three powerful little words help us frame a problem statement in a powerful, inclusive way.

- **How** suggesting that we don't yet know what the solution is.
- **Might** suggesting that a solution is possible and there could be several ways to implement it.
- **We** brings everyone together to help solve the problem.

You'll see this quite a bit when practicing Design Thinking.  I suggest you try it yourself and see how it invites collaboration help open up your problem statement to new perspectives.  Let's take a look at a quick example:

**from**

>Build a reccomender system for streaming music

**to**

>How might we queue up music that will delight users so that they listen for hours?

Notice the difference? Much more inspiring and also brings the user into the problem.


## Design Thinking Methods

There are many different design thinking methods that you can utilize.  There probably are hundreds or even thousands of them. Different organizations have curated "systems" of design thinking methods and selected ones for you such as [IDEO's Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/methods), [Google Design Sprints](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) or the set that I'm certified in, the [LUMA Institute's Methods](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).


Here are a full list of the LUMA methods from their [website](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).  We'll cover several of these in this post, but in reality, every one of these can apply at some point in time to Data Science.  Each method is documented on their website if you'd like to learn more.

Let's get started! 

## Design Thinking Tools

The core set of tools for design thinking is typically [Post-It Notes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RK52772), [Sharpies](https://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-30001-Permanent-Markers-Point/dp/B00006IFHD), [Voting Dots](https://www.amazon.com/ChromaLabel-Removable-Color-Code-Assorted-Fluorescent/dp/B08MT7XMQ2), and [Easel Pads](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-559VAD4PK-Premium-Sticking/dp/B000N4AI8M).  These incredibly simple items can help you run sessions in a room that produce amazing outcomes.  

One of the amazing things that's happened over the past few years is the proliferation of digital tools that help facilitate virtual design thinking sessions.  Tools such as [MURAL](https://mural.co), [Miro](https://miro.com), [Google Jamboard](https://workspace.google.com/products/jamboard/), and [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) from Figma are all great tools that help.  Each of these has a free option that can get you started on your journey.  

My personal tool of Choice is [MURAL](https://mural.co).  I often use it as a personal productivity tool as well.

Some of these are even loaded up with [templates](https://www.mural.co/templates) that get you started faster.

## Stakeholder Management

Whenever starting a project you want to think about who your users, or stakeholders are.  This could be internal members of sales, service, or engineering, or they could be executives, or external customers.  Each one of these stakeholders has a different set of needs and wants.  This is where Stakeholder Management comes in.  There are two simple methods that you can use to 

The first method I like to do anytime i start a new project is to run a [**Stakeholder Mapping**](https://www.luma-institute.com/stakeholder-mapping/) exercise.  This is a great exercise to do with a your team if you can.  It helps build a shared understanding of who the most important people are.  I like to start off with a tree like structure with the most important people at the top and build from there.  Then map each player based on their level of involement in the project.

After you have identified all of the key people, you can map them to a simple two-by-two matrix with **Influence** and **Interest/Availabilty** as your axis.  This based on where they land, you can determine your engagement model for them such as **Keep Satisfied**, **Activley Engage**, **Keep Informed**, and **Monitor**.  A simple model to keep your structured in your engagement.

![Stakeholder Map]({static}../../images/posts/designthinking_sm.png)

Next, based on my stakeholder map I like to think about my [**Interviewing**](https://www.luma-institute.com/interviewing/) strategy.  Who will I talk to to ensure that I understand my customer's needs properly.  Interviewing is a simple process but there are a few best practices.  First ensure that you have the person's consent if you're recording the interview for later use. Next, make sure that you have a consistent set of questions so that you can compare across interviewees.  Start with simple questions and then get more specific as you go.  Finally, make sure you're a good listener, and that you're not leading the person to the answer that you want.


## Identifying the Most Important Problem to Solve

As you start out on a project, it's critical for you to make sure you're solving the right problem.  We started with identifying our stakeholders and interviewing them, but how do we pull out the most important problem that a great way to determine what is most critical to work on is to get all of your stakeholders together for a facilitated session and have them generate ideas in realtime.  There are a lot of different methods to us, but two that I utilize frequently are the combination of a divergent activity called **Creative Matrix** and then a convergent activity called **Visualize the Vote**.

The [**Creative Matrix**](https://www.luma-institute.com/creative-matrix/) contains rows and colums that allow you to give your participants a litle help around where ideas fit.  The rows typically represent some sort of **enabler**, such as technology, environments, locations, games, and more.  The columns typically represent **people or a problem statement**.  For people it can be roles such as sales, service, engineer or any problem statement.  Typically if you use problem statements, you might want to brainstorm with your group to come up with those problem statements before you start this exercise.

Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and encourage people to fill in all the boxes of the matrix with ideas.  Even point out areas that are lacking and guide them to fill the boxes in.

![Creative Matrix]({static}../../images/posts/designthinking_cm.png)

After you've generated ideas in the Creative Matrix, you can narrow these down by having participants vote on the most impactful things with a technique called [**Vizualize the Vote**](https://www.luma-institute.com/visualize-the-vote/).  Give each person a number of voting dots (stickers), 4-5 typically works well, and have them sliently review, and place them on the the board.  After you're finished you can extact the top voted ideas and further develop them.

As a bonus, electronic tools such as [MURAL](https://support.mural.co/en/articles/2113758-run-a-voting-session) have voting mechnisms build right in! 

## Prioritizing Work

Often times when you have a large backlog of work, you need additional assistance in choosing the best order to work on them.  There are lots of techniques for prioritizing work, but if you want to do this collaboratively there are some fun techniques such as **Buy a Feature** and **Importance Difficulty Matrix**.

[**Buy a Feature**](https://www.luma-institute.com/buy-a-feature/) is a tool that allows you to have your participants put a weighted value on various features they want to vote on.  You start by assiging a dollar value to each of the features you have.  This value should be based off of the relative size of effort or implementation for the feature.  A really massive undertaking might have a really high value, where as something that could be done in a day or so might have a smaller value.

Give your participants a limited amount of money to spend.  They'll be then forced to choose how much they want to spend on each feature.  You can instruct them to split it up any way that they wish, including putting all the money onto a single feature.  

One really cool trick with this technique is to make a feature that is very costly to implement is impossible to buy with the amount of money that they have.  For example it could bit $200 to buy it, but they only receive $100.  Then tell them that they can work together to pool their money as a group to fund this more expensive features.

Next up is the [**Importance/Difficulty Matrix**](https://www.luma-institute.com/importance-difficulty-matrix/).  Also a great tool for working together as a group.  There are two axes that represent two distinct values.  You start by putting a single idea in the middle bottom of the board.  Then take your next idea and determine if it is more important or less than the one placed in the middle.  Continue this process until they're all laid out along the bottom as in the image below.

Next, take one idea and place move it vertically up to the middle of the board.  Then repeat the process until all ideas are ranked.  One really critical tip for this exercise is that each note should only occupy one row or column on the board.  This forces the group to not place everything in one quadarant.  Every idea is relative important and difficultiy to each other.  What you end up with is four quadrants that represent **Quick Wins**, **Best Bets**, **Moonshots**, and **Low Priority** based on importance and ease of implementation.

## Getting Thoughful Critique

I've found in my career that getting positive feedback is easy, getting critique (not critisim) can be very difficult.  Often times, people don't want to say something that they might consider negative.  This is a bad cultural issue at companies, but I've seen it over and over again.  A fantastic way to overcome this is to utilize the technique [**Rose-Thorn-Bud**](https://www.luma-institute.com/rose-thorn-bud/) which provides a convienient way bring ideas of the following types:

* **Rose**: Positive things
* **Thorn**: Negative things
* **Bud**: Things that have potential

With these categories, it's easy for your participants to give you feedback of all types.  Make sure after the ideas are genearated that you discuss them as a group.  You'll find that this method works wonders for providing feedback which gets you beyond the fluffy "everything is great" feedback you might typically receive.

## Determing the Usability of Your Solution

So, you've built your latest dashboard, your churn prediction utility, or your amazing forcasting model.  How do you get feedback on its usability? We can use common techniques used in product development to evaluate our data science projects no different than any other product.  In my team, we do usability studies all the time on our data products and dashboards.

The first technique I like to use is [**Experience Diagramming**](https://www.luma-institute.com/experience-diagramming/).  This method has a user walk through their journey through your tool and then give and indication as to how their experience was along the way.  Start with a horizontal line and on the top have **positive experience** and at the bottom, **negative experience**.  Then have the user write down the flow through the tool.  Each step of the process and place that step above the line or below.  This will give you a great indication of what's working and what's not in the eyes of the user.

![Experience Diagramming]({static}../../images/posts/designthinking_exp.png)

If you want a more systematic, and repeatable usability test you can use [**System Usability Scale**](https://www.luma-institute.com/system-usability-scale/) or SUS.  SUS is a proven method for determining usability.  It is a simple 10 question survey that asks questions:

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
3. I thought the system was easy to use.
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
9. I felt very confident using the system.
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

You can read a little more about it [here](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html).  You can even administer this with digital survey tools like Survey Monkey or [Question Pro](https://www.questionpro.com/survey-templates/system-usability-scale-survey-questions-template/). 

## Build a Launch Plan, Before You Build

Finally, you're ready to launch your Data Scienace project.  The good news is that you don't have to wait for all the work to be completed to start thinking about your launch.  They can be done right at the initiation of your product.

The first method is to develop a [**Concept Poster**](https://www.luma-institute.com/concept-poster/).  This framework makes it simple to think about some of the practicalities of building and launching a solution.  In a concept post your fill out the problem you're trying to solve, the key stakeholders, the big idea, reasons it might fail, how to prototype and test and finally how you'll measure success. You also can include an illustration of the idea to drive it home.

![Concept Poster]({static}../../images/posts/designthinking_cp.png)

And last but not least is the [**Cover Story Mockup**](https://www.luma-institute.com/cover-story-mock-up/).  This is similar to writing a press release for your product launch but helps you tell the story about the impact you will make from the onset of the project.  You'll find that by creating a cover story or press release, that the project team members will have a better understanding of the customer value that you want to create, since the story is centered around your customer.  Have fun with these.  Include details about the value created, and even fake customer quotes based on the type of feedback you hope to receive.

## Conclusion

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation and has the ability to bring people together, and form new ideas that you might not even thought were possible before you started.  I covered methods on how to identify and prioritize how you interact with stakeholders on your project.  Ways to generation a divergent set of ideas and then naorrow them down to the most important ones.  I covered a couple of ways to prioritze your work via the inclusion of your stakeholders.  When you're ready for feedback, the Rose-Thorn-Bud method was covered as an excellent way to solicit critique.  I presented two different methods for determininng the usability of your solution that can help you fine tune what you build.  Finally, I shared a couple of ways to think about the launch of your product before it launches.  This article is just a high-level overview of how Design Thinking can be incorporated into your Data Science work.  I encourage you to learn more and start to leverage one or two techniques!
