# What is Design Thinking?

The first thing you might be thinking is "What does design thinking have to do with Data Science?!"  Let's start with a definition of [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) and then let's see how everyone can apply Design Thinking Methods to Data Science.

According to one the early pioneers of Design thinking, [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com), they define Design Thinking as:

>Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designerâ€™s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

A few things jump out.  First is that it's a human-centered approach, which means that you're designing solutions in service of people, not of technology.  Every Data Scientist and Analyst should be thinking about the user first! Second is that it's taking tools from designers and applying them to generalized business success. Design Thinking isn't just for designers and it certainly isn't just for software User Interfaces (UI)!

As a Data Scientist, there are numerous ways that you can incorporate Design Thinking into your work to help solve problems such as:

1. Stakeholder Management
2. Identifying the Most Important Problem to Solve
3. Prioritizing Work
4. Getting Thoughful Critique
5. Determing the Usability of Your Solution
6. Build a Launch Plan

Before jumping in, let's take a look a a few fundamentals of Design Thinking.

## The Double Diamond

The first I want to talk about is the concept of the **Double Diamond**.  The [Double Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)) is a core concept in design thinking and helps you frame how to think about approaching a problem, and developing a solution.  The concept is that you start from left and do two sets of **divergent** and **convergent** exercises that help you first identify **the problem** to solve, and then explore a broad space again around the solution, finally coming up with **the solution**.  Two words you will hear a lot in design thinking are divergent and convergent.

- **Divergent**: Opening your mind to a broad range of possibiliites. As my friend and mentor says
>"it's easier to tame a wild idea than to amplify a weak one.
- **Convergent**: Narrowing down the range of possibilities to a singular one.

The Double Diamond and divergent and convergent thinking are applied to different methods in design thinking to help facilitate comming up with the soltuion.

## How Might We

You may have heard this phrase before, **How Might We** which is often abbreviated to **HMW**. These three powerful little words help us frame a problem statement in a powerful, inclusive way.

- **How** suggesting that we don't yet know what the solution is.
- **Might** suggesting that a solution is possible and there could be several ways to implement it.
- **We** brings everyone together to help solve the problem.

You'll see this quite a bit when practicing Design Thinking.  I suggest you try it yourself and see how it invites collaboration help open up your problem statement to new perspectives.  Let's take a look at a quick example:

**from**

>Build a reccomender system for streaming music

**to**

>How might we queue up music that will delight users so that they listen for hours?

Notice the difference? Much more inspiring and also brings the user into the problem.


## Design Thinking Methods

There are many different design thinking methods that you can utilize.  There probably are hundreds or even thousands of them. Different organizations have curated "systems" of design thinking methods and selected ones for you such as [IDEO's Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/methods), [Google Design Sprints](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) or the set that I'm certified in, the [LUMA Institudes Methods](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).


Here are a full list of the LUMA methods from their [website](https://www.luma-institute.com/about-luma/luma-system-explore-methods/).  We'll cover several of these in this post, but in reality, every one of these can apply at some point in time to Data Science.  Each method is documented on their website if you'd like to learn more.

Let's get started! 

## Design Thinking Tools

The core set of tools for design thinking is typically [Post-It Notes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RK52772), [Sharpies](https://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-30001-Permanent-Markers-Point/dp/B00006IFHD), [Voting Dots](https://www.amazon.com/ChromaLabel-Removable-Color-Code-Assorted-Fluorescent/dp/B08MT7XMQ2), and [Easel Pads](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-559VAD4PK-Premium-Sticking/dp/B000N4AI8M).  These incredibly simple items can help you run sessions in a room that produce amazing outcomes.  

One of the amazing things that's happened over the past few years is the proliferation of digital tools that help facilitate virtual design thinking sessions.  Tools such as [MURAL](https://mural.co), [Miro](https://miro.com), [Google Jamboard](https://workspace.google.com/products/jamboard/), and [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) from Figma are all great tools that help.  Each of these has a free option that can get you started on your journey.  

My personal tool of Choice is [MURAL](https://mural.co).  I often use it as a personal productivity tool as well.

Some of these are even loaded up with [templates](https://www.mural.co/templates) that get you started faster.

## Stakeholder Management

Whenever starting a project you want to think about who your users, or stakeholders are.  This could be internal members of sales, service, or engineering, or they could be executives, or external customers.  Each one of these stakeholders has a different set of needs and wants.  This is where Stakeholder Management comes in.  There are two simple methods that you can use to 

The first method I like to do anytime i start a new project is to run a [**Stakeholder Mapping**](https://www.luma-institute.com/stakeholder-mapping/) exercise.  This is a great exercise to do with a your team if you can.  It helps build a shared understanding of who the most important people are.  I like to start off with a tree like structure with the most important people at the top and build from there.  Then map each player based on their level of involement in the project.

Next, based on my stakeholder map I like to think about my [**Interviewing**](https://www.luma-institute.com/interviewing/) strategy.  Who will I talk to to ensure that I understand my customer's needs properly.  Interviewing is a simple process but there are a few best practices.  First ensure that you have the person's consent if you're recording the interview for later use. Next, make sure that you have a consistent set of questions so that you can compare across interviewees.  Start with simple questions and then get more specific as you go.  Finally, make sure you're a good listener, and that you're not leading the person to the answer that you want.


## Identifying the Most Important Problem to Solve

As you start out on a project, it's critical for you to make sure you're solving the right problem.  We started with identifying our stakeholders and interviewing them, but how do we pull out the most important problem that
