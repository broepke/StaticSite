## How to Create a Compelling Slide Deck

As a data scientist, or an analyst, we spend countless hours perfecting our ability to analyze data, build machine learning models, and keep up with the latest technology trends.  One skill however, that everyone needs is the ability to create a compelling data science presentation.

>I can not stress enough, that every Data Scientist, Analyst and Data Engineer needs to get good at building a compelling presentation.

Here are tips and tricks I've gathered over the years presenting to executives, customers, and peers.  None of these tips are actually limited to Data Science, they can be used for anyone creating a presentation.  Let's take a qucik look at them.

1. Start with an Outline
2. Situation, complication, resolution
3. The one miniute per slide rule
4. The rule of three
5. Pyramid principle
6. Reading titles outloud
7. Data story technquies

Let's get started! 

## Start With an Outline

Often times, when starting a presentation, they open PowerPoint, Keynote or their tool of choice and start trying to immedialy build the deck.  This issues of course is you're going to iterate 100 times on the slides and probably end up deleting most of what you've created.

A better way to approach this is to start with an outline, No different than you were taught in English 101.  But don't think of this as an outline of the slides you want to create, think of this as the story you're going to tell.  That's next.

## Situation, Complication, Resolution

## Pyramid Principle

## Reading Titles Outloud

There are [plenty](https://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation) [of](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/please-stop-reading-off-your-powerpoint-slides-heres-what-to-do-instead.html) [articles](https://www.techwell.com/2013/10/give-better-presentation-don-t-read-your-slides) that will tell you not to read your slides outloud.  Reading your content directly from your slides is a sure fire way to bore your audiece and loose their attention.

However, I have one caveat to that rule; **read your slide titles outloud**.  

According to [Naegle](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009554): 

>reading and verbal processing use the same cognitive channelsâ€”therefore, an audience member can either read the slide, listen to you, or do some part of both (each poorly), as a result of cognitive overload.
