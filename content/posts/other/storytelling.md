## How to Create a Compelling Slide Deck

As a data scientist, or an analyst, we spend countless hours perfecting our ability to analyze data, build machine learning models, and keep up with the latest technology trends.  One skill however, that everyone needs is the ability to create a compelling data science presentation.

**I can not stress enough, that every Data Scientist, Analyst and Data Engineer needs to get good at building a compelling presentation.**

Here are tips and tricks I've gathered over 20 years of presenting to executives, customers, and peers.  None of these tips are actually limited to Data Science and can be used for anyone creating a presentation.  Let's take a qucik look at them.

1. Start With an Outline
2. Storytelling with Situation, Complication, Resolution
3. The One Miniute Per Slide Rule
4. The Rule of Three
5. Write Slide Titles as Outcomes
6. Reading Titles Outloud
7. Bolding Keywords
8. Creating Compelling Data Visualizations

Let's get started! 

## Start With an Outline

Often times, when starting a presentation, they open PowerPoint, Keynote or their tool of choice and start trying to immedialy build the deck.  This issues of course is you're going to iterate 100 times on the slides and probably end up deleting most of what you've created.  

A better way to approach this is to start with an outline, No different than you were taught in English 101.  But don't think of this as an outline of the slides you want to create, think of this as the story you're going to tell.  There are two common ways to create an outline. The first is by simply using orderd lists and scructure your online by ideas or sections of your story (I'll cover the stoytelling part next) or if you're a more visual person you can use a mind mapp and structure it similarily.

Once you have your ouline set, creating the supporting content is a breeze.

## Storytelling with Situation, Complication, Resolution

A classic story telling framework is known as the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).  The general idea is that a hero goes on a journey, some sort of obstical is introduced into and finally the hero is able to overcome that obstical and everyone lives hapily ever after.

In our business presentations we can use a similar framework called **Situation-Complication-Resolution** or SCR.  I was first introduced to SCR through the book [The Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/1292372265/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+pyramid+principle+logic+in+writing+and+thinking&qid=1653223332) by Barbara Minto who popularized this method while working at McKinsey Consulting.  The structure of this is perfect for creating a business story.  It's a simple framework, it keeps you organized in your structure and it brings action oriented results.

* **Situation**: Facts about the current state.
* **Complication**: The reason action is required based on the situation.
* **Resolution**: The action taken or reccomended to solve the complication.

Using our outline format, here is an overly simplified example of of SCR.  In practice, you would introduce more details as sub items of the nodes.  In practice, utilizing SCR will help you create a clean, compelling story!

## The One Miniute Per Slide Rule

This one is simple and effective. As opposed to creating your presentation and reherssing the timing, just consider that each major content slide will **take one minute to present**.  If you have a 20 minute presentation, aim for 20 slides with content.  This doesn't include section dividers, the cover or a closing logo slide.  

## The Rule of Three

## Write Slide Titles as Outcomes



## Reading Titles Outloud

There are [plenty](https://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation) [of](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/please-stop-reading-off-your-powerpoint-slides-heres-what-to-do-instead.html) [articles](https://www.techwell.com/2013/10/give-better-presentation-don-t-read-your-slides) that will tell you not to read your slides outloud.  Reading your content directly from your slides is a sure fire way to bore your audiece and loose their attention.

However, I have one caveat to that rule; **read your slide titles outloud**.  

According to [Naegle](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009554): 

>Reading and verbal processing use the same cognitive channelsâ€”therefore, an audience member can either read the slide, listen to you, or do some part of both (each poorly), as a result of cognitive overload.

By reading just the tile and title only as you start each slide, the audience will be able to process the message much more easily vs. reading the words that are written and listening to you at the same time.  While this might feel uncomfortable at first, practice it a bit with some colleagues and see for yourself! 

For the rest of the slide, do not to read the conntent, especially if you ues a lot of bulleted or ordered lists.  This can be monotonous as mentiond above.
