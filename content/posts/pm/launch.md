# Product Management, Lean Startup, and the MVP

Most of my career has been in **Product Management** and over my 20+ years I've built a few companies, a lot of products from scratch, and even sold one to a technology company in the Bay Area. I've had the fortune of learning a lot about how to build better products. When I transitioned to my role as the leader of a Data Science and Analytics organization, I took all the things that I learned about building products and put them to work in every aspect of what I deliver.  The first and most important thing I teach people.  **Launch early** and **often**, **get feedback**, and **iterate**.

One of the common mistakes a Data Scientist makes is to wait for **what they think is perfection** before the let anyone see what thev've built.  Whether this is a model's performance, the design of a dashboard, or the summary of their findings.  The biggest problem with waiting for "perfection" is that no solution is ever perfect, or even close to perfect the first time you get feedback.  A better way is to get the bare-bones working and start getting feedbback from your users.  This is the core of **the Lean Startup methodology** and the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.

In this article, we will explore how data scientists and analysts can learn from product managers about the principles of lean startup and MVPs to build better products. We will cover the following topics:

* **Understanding the Lean Startup Methodology**: We will introduce the concept of the Lean Startup methodology and how it can help companies to validate their ideas quickly and cheaply.
* **Exploring the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: We will explain what an MVP is and how it can help companies to focus on what is truly important to users.
* **Learning from Product Managers**: We will discuss how data scientists and analysts can work closely with product managers to leverage the principles of lean startup and MVPs in their product development.
* **Benefits of Leveraging Lean Startup and MVPs**: We will highlight the benefits of using these principles, including how they can help companies to be more agile and adaptable in their product development.


By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of how to leverage the principles of lean startup and MVPs to build better products that meet the needs of your users. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or product manager, these principles can help you to develop products that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace.

## The Lean Startup Methodology

The [Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) methodology is an approach to product development that emphasizes getting feedback from users early on in the process. This approach is designed to help companies avoid wasting time and resources on developing products that don't meet the needs of users.

To leverage the principles of the lean startup methodology, data scientists and analysts should start by identifying their target users and understanding their needs. This requires conducting research and gathering data on user behavior, preferences, and pain points. Once they have a clear understanding of their target users, they can start developing hypotheses about how to meet their needs.

The next step is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that addresses one or more of these hypotheses. The MVP should be simple and easy to use, and it should provide users with a clear value proposition. This could be in the form of a prototype, a wireframe, or a mockup.

Once the MVP is created, it's important to get feedback from users as soon as possible. This can be done through user testing, surveys, or other forms of feedback gathering. The goal is to validate the hypotheses and get insights into how users are interacting with the product.

Based on this feedback, data scientists and analysts can iterate on the MVP and make improvements. This process of iterating and testing should continue until the product meets the needs of users and is ready to be launched.

## The Role of Product Managers in Lean Startup

Product managers play a critical role in the lean startup methodology. They are responsible for identifying user needs, defining product requirements, and prioritizing features. They work closely with development teams to ensure that the product is meeting the needs of users and that it is being developed in an efficient and effective way.

To leverage the role of product managers in lean startup, data scientists and analysts should seek to work closely with product managers on their projects. They should collaborate with product managers to understand the user needs and product requirements, and to prioritize features based on user feedback.

Data scientists and analysts can also leverage the expertise of product managers in defining and refining the MVP. Product managers can provide valuable insights into user needs and preferences, and they can help data scientists and analysts identify the key features that will make the product successful.

In addition, product managers can help data scientists and analysts navigate the complexities of product development, including managing stakeholders, setting deadlines, and ensuring that the product meets the needs of the business.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The concept of the minimum viable product (MVP) is a key component of the lean startup methodology. The MVP is a product that has just enough features to satisfy early customers and to provide feedback for future product development. The MVP is designed to be created quickly and cheaply, so that companies can validate their ideas before investing too much time and money.

To leverage the concept of MVPs, data scientists and analysts should start by identifying the key features that are required to meet the needs of users. They should focus on creating a product that provides a clear value proposition and that addresses one or more of the user needs.

The MVP should be simple and easy to use, with a user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly. It should provide users with a clear sense of what the product does and how it can help them.

Once the MVP is created, data scientists and analysts should focus on getting feedback from users as soon as possible. This can be done through user testing, surveys, or other forms of feedback gathering. The goal is to validate the hypotheses and to get insights into how users are interacting with the product.

Based on this feedback, data scientists and analysts can iterate on the MVP and make improvements.

## Benefits of Leveraging Lean Startup and MVPs

There are several benefits to leveraging the principles of lean startup and MVPs in product development. One of the key benefits is that it allows companies to validate their ideas quickly and cheaply, before investing too much time and money. This can help them avoid the risk of developing products that don't meet the needs of users or that are too expensive to develop.

Another benefit is that it helps companies to focus on what is truly important to users. By prioritizing features based on user feedback, companies can ensure that they are delivering the most value to users. This can help them to build products that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace.

Finally, leveraging lean startup and MVPs can help companies to be more agile and adaptable in their product development. By iterating on the MVP and making improvements based on user feedback, companies can respond more quickly to changing market conditions and user needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, data scientists and analysts can learn a lot from product managers about the principles of lean startup and MVPs. By working closely with product managers and leveraging these principles in their product development, data scientists and analysts can build products that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace.  To successfully leverage these principles, data scientists and analysts should focus on understanding their target users, creating simple and easy-to-use MVPs, and getting feedback from users as soon as possible. By following these steps and iterating on their MVPs based on user feedback, they can build products that meet the needs of users and that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace.
