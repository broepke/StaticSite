## About Me

I am a **Data Science and Analytics** leader for a large cloud platform.  I spent most of my career in Product Management and product leadership, building multiple products from zero into long-term sustainable businesses.

Since around 2018, I've been studying **Machine Learning** and **Analytics**, even as far as graduating with a **BSc in Data Analytics** in 2021.  I took the opportunity to transform my career and move full-time into this new field.

I am a certified practitioner of **Human-Centered Design** and love utilizing **Design Thinking** methods and techniques to bring out the best in people and build the most innovative, inclusive solutions. I leverage my long history in product management to deliver everything I do, from ML pipelines to Dashboards as products. I focus on delivering high value, great user experience, and the right outcomes.

I try to contribute small articles in this blog that might help new and aspiring Data Science professionals.  I hope you enjoy it.  Leave comments and I'll respond as soon as I can.
