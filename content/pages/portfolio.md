### Tesla User Forums "Voice of Customer" Analysis

This was a final project for a class in R and NLP.  I built a web scraper for pulling forum posts from the official [Tesla site](https://forums.tesla.com/categories/tesla-model-3) and, in turn, performed various text analyses across the 54,000 posts downloaded.

The report looked at userâ€™s discussions, mostly in 2020, from the Tesla Model 3 Discussion Forums to surface what is top of mind and what issues might still affect the Model 3. The forums are open where people can post topics, ask questions, or generally participate in the community. User forums are rich with information that can give an alternative view into customer sentiment, unlike Social Media or traditional Surveys.  This report did not look to surface the root cause of issues, but rather surface topics that are most top-of-mind for customers and where the Tesla team could investigate further.
